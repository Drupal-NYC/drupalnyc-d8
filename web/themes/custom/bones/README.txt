Compiling Sass using Gulp (Mac OSX)
Bones uses Gulp to compile sass, but you can use whatever preprocessor you like.
To run Gulp you must have the required node packages installed.

Bones uses the following packages:

- Gulp
- Gulp-sass
- Gulp-sourcemaps
- Gulp-autoprefixer
- Node-sass-globbing
- Gulp-plumber
- Gulp-cssmin
- Browser-sync
- Breakpoint-sass
- Compass-mixins

To setup a new theme to build with Gulp:

1. Open terminal
2. cd to the theme directory.
3. Run "npm install" or "yarn install" to install the required packages. 
4. Open the gulpfile.js and update the Browser-sync proxy location to your
   local development address (line 24).
5. Open the scss files and make your changes.
6. Run "npm run dev" or "yarn dev". 
7. Browser sync should automatically open a new browser tab. You will have to
   login to the site here to see changes appear.
8. Flush the cache and the new changes should appear automatically after each
   .scss file save.
