## Vendor Directory
The vendor directory is a special directory used to store third-party libraries that this project depends on.

These libraries are managed separately and are not part of our application's source code. They may include frameworks, utilities, and other packages that provide functionality our application needs.

It's important to note that the files in the vendor directory will not be compiled by the theme's build tools, nor will it be watched for changes. These files are already in a format that the browser can interpret (like JavaScript or CSS), and compiling them again could lead to unexpected results or errors.
